## Overview

Our good friend Steve has come to us for help to analyze a handful of stocks of green energy companies and assist his parents in their investment strategy. Before we came on board, Steve's parents invested all their money into DAQO New Energy Corp (ticker "DQ") and we are to look into DQ's stock performance as well as a dozen other companies in the industry. We have created a VBA script to run through data for 12 stock tickers for 2017 and 2018 and return total daily volume traded and annual stock performance for each ticker, so now Steve can analyze an entire dataset at the click of a button.

Now Steve wants to be able to expand the dataset to analyze the entire stock market over the last few years, so we have to revise our VBA script to refactor the code and make it more efficient and run faster with larger datasets. We have added a timer function to the code to be able to measure and compare how fast the code runs for the original and the refactored scripts.
